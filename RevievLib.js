    "Most of my tattoo's are from Rob. He's a great men and I love his work. I come with a crappy drawning as I can't draw very well and he turns it into art. What  I like is that I can say what I'm seeing in my head, my vision and he turns it into what i want.",
    "I saw Big Rob this past weekend. He's the best. He just finished some great work on my arm. I plan on going back to have him clean some other work up. Go see him, you will be happy.",
    "I was looking to have same cleanup work done to a band on my leg, but didn't want to just go to some shap that would imitate wthat they consider a Old school style. So i was incredibly happy to find an artist like Mat in the area. Prices were really reasonable and you'll be more than satisfied with the final results.",
